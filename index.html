      <h2>TECNOLOGIA</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        Usamos um escâner 3D para criar um modelo virtual do artefato com um software Computer Aided Design (CAD) e uma
        impressora 3D para imprimi‐lo em plástico. Estas máquinas criam com perfeição as projeções em três dimensões com materiais
        semelhantes ao vegetal, ao osso, à cerâmica e à rocha, sem causar dano ao artefato original.
        <br>
        Os equipamentos usados podem ser transportados para os espaços das instituições parceiras, evitando o deslocamento
        das coleções e permitindo o acompanhamento do processo pela comunidade.
